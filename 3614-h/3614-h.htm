<h1>AN EXHORTATION TO PEACE AND UNITY.</h1>
<p>[We deem it proper to state, that, though the following
Treatise of Christian Union appears in nearly all the collected
editions of <span class="smcap">Bunyan&rsquo;s Works</span>, yet
its genuineness has been called in question by the Rev. Mr Philip
in his admirable work, &ldquo;The Life and Times of
Bunyan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without here entering into this question, we
have separately appended it to the works of Bunyan in this
volume, and trust that it will not prove unacceptable to our
readers, especially considering the efforts that are now being
made to promote the living union of all true Christians who hold
the one Lord, the one faith, and the one baptism.]</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Endeavouring to keep
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</i>.&mdash;Ephesians
iv. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Beloved</span>, religion is the great bond
of human society; and it were well if itself were kept within the
bond of unity; and that it may so be, let us, according to the
text, use our utmost endeavours &ldquo;to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words contain a counsel and a caution: the counsel is,
That we endeavour the unity of the Spirit; the caution is, That
we do it in the bond of peace; as if I should say, I would have
you live in unity, but yet I would have you to be careful that
you do not purchase unity with the breach of charity.</p>
<p>Let us therefore be cautious that we do not so press after
unity in practice and opinion as to break the bond of peace and
affection.</p>
<p>In the handling of these words, I shall observe this
method.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; I shall open the sense of the text.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I shall shew wherein this unity and peace
consist.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; I shall shew you the fruits and benefits of it,
together with nine inconveniences and mischiefs that attend those
churches where unity and peace is wanting.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; And, lastly, I shall give you twelve directions and
motives for the obtaining of it.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As touching the sense of the text, when ye are
counselled to keep the unity of the Spirit, we are not to
understand the Spirit of God, as personally so considered;
because the Spirit of God, in that sense, is not capable of being
divided, and so there would be no need for us to endeavour to
keep the unity of it.</p>
<p>By the unity of the spirit then, we are to understand that
unity of mind which the Spirit of God calls for, and requires
Christians to endeavour after; hence it is that we are exhorted,
by one spirit, with one mind, to strive together for the faith of
the gospel; Phil. i. 27.</p>
<p>But farther, the apostle in these words alludes to the state
and composition of a natural body, and doth thereby inform us,
that the mystical body of Christ holds an analogy with the
natural body of man: as, 1.&nbsp; In the natural body there must
be a spirit to animate it; for the body without the spirit is
dead; James ii. 26.&nbsp; So it is in the mystical body of
Christ; the apostle no sooner tells of that one body, but he
minds us of that one Spirit; Eph. iv. 4.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The body hath joints and hands to unite all the
parts; so hath the mystical body of Christ; Col. ii. 19.&nbsp;
This is that bond of peace mentioned in the text, as also in the
16th verse of the same chapter, where the whole body is said to
be fitly joined together, and compacted, by that which every
joint supplieth.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The natural body receives counsel and nourishment
from the head; so doth the mystical body of Christ; he is their
counsellor, and him they must hear; he is their head, and him
they must hold: hence it is that the apostle complaineth, Col.
ii. 19, of some that did not hold the head from which the whole
body by joints and hands hath nourishment.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The natural body cannot well subsist, if either the
spirit be wounded or the joints broken or dislocated; the body
cannot bear a wounded or broken spirit&mdash;&ldquo;A broken
spirit drieth the bones;&rdquo; Prov. xvii. 22, and &ldquo;A
wounded spirit who can bear?&rdquo; Prov. xviii. 14.&nbsp; And,
on the other hand, how often have the disjointing of the body,
and the breakings thereof, occasioned the expiration of the
spirit?&nbsp; In like manner it fares with the mystical body of
Christ; how do divided spirits break the bonds of peace, which
are the joints of this body?&nbsp; And how do the breakings of
the body and church of Christ wound the spirit of Christians, and
oftentimes occasion the spirit and life of Christianity to
languish, if not to expire.&nbsp; How needful is it then that we
endeavour the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace!</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I now come to shew you wherein this unity and peace
consists; and this I shall demonstrate in five particulars.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This unity and peace may consist with the ignorance
of many truths, and in the holding of some errors; or else this
duty of peace and unity could not be practicable by any on this
side perfection: but we must now endeavour the unity of the
spirit, till we come to the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God; Eph. iv. 13.&nbsp; Because now, as
the apostle saith, &ldquo;We know in part, and we prophesy in
part,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Now we see through a glass darkly;&rdquo;
1 Cor. xiii. 9, 12.&nbsp; And as this is true in general, so we
may find it true if we descend to particular instances.&nbsp; The
disciples seem to be ignorant of that great truth which they had
often, and in much plainness, been taught by their Master once
and again, viz., that his kingdom was not of this world, and that
in the world they should suffer and be persecuted; yet in the 1st
of the Acts, ver. 6, we read, that they asked of him if he would
at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? thereby discovering
that Christ&rsquo;s kingdom (as they thought) should consist in
his temporal jurisdiction over Israel, which they expected should
now commence and take place amongst them.&nbsp; Again, our Lord
tells them, that he had many things to say (and these were many
important truths) which they could not now bear; John xvi.
12.&nbsp; And that these were important truths, appear by the
10th and 11th verses, where he is discoursing of righteousness
and judgment, and then adds, that he had yet many things to say
which they could not bear; and thereupon promises the Comforter
to lead them into <span class="GutSmall">ALL TRUTH</span>; which
implies, that they were yet ignorant of many truths, and
consequently held divers errors; and yet for all this, he prays
for, and presses them to, their great duty of peace and unity;
John xiv. 27; xvii. 21.&nbsp; To this may be added that of Heb.
v. 11, where the author saith, he had many things to say of the
priestly office of Christ, which by reason of their dulness they
were not capable to receive; as also that in the 10th of the
Acts, where Peter seems to be ignorant of the truth, viz., that
the gospel was to be preached to all nations; and contrary
hereunto, he erred in thinking it unlawful to preach amongst the
Gentiles.&nbsp; I shall add two texts more, one in Acts xix.,
where we read that those disciples which had been discipled and
baptized by John were yet ignorant of the Holy Ghost, and knew
not (as the text tells us) whether there were any holy Ghost or
no; though John did teach constantly, that he that should come
after him should baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire.&nbsp; From
hence we may easily and plainly infer, that Christians may be
ignorant of many truths, by reason of weak and dull capacities,
and other such like impediments, even while those truths are with
much plainness delivered to them.&nbsp; Again, we read, Heb. v.
13, of some that were unskilful in the word of righteousness, who
nevertheless are called babes in Christ, and with whom unity and
peace is to be inviolably kept and maintained.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As this unity and peace may consist with the
ignorance of many truths, and with the holding some errors, so it
must consist with (and it cannot consist without) the believing
and practising those things which are necessary to salvation and
church-communion; and they are, 1st, Believing that Christ the
Son of God died for the sins of men.&nbsp; 2d, That whoever
believeth ought to be baptized.&nbsp; The third thing essential
to this communion, is a holy and a blameless conversation.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; That believing that the Son of God died for the
sins of men is necessary to salvation, I prove by these texts,
which tell us, that he that doth not believe shall be damned,
Mark xvi. 16; John iii. 36; Rom. x. 9.</p>
<p>That it is also necessary to church-communion appears from
Matt. xvi. 16&ndash;18.&nbsp; Peter having confessed that Christ
was the Son of the living God, Christ thereupon assures Peter,
that upon this rock, viz., this profession of faith, or this
Christ which Peter had confessed, he would build his church, and
the gates of hell should not prevail against it.&nbsp; And, 1
Cor. iii. 11, the apostle having told the Corinthians that they
were God&rsquo;s building, presently adds, that they could not be
built upon any foundation but upon that which was laid, which was
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; All which proves, that Christian society is
founded upon the profession of Christ; and not only scripture,
but the laws of right reason, dictate this, that some rules and
orders must be observed for the founding all society, which must
be consented to by all that will be of it.&nbsp; Hence it comes
to pass, that to own Christ as the Lord and head of Christians is
essential to the founding of Christian society.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The Scriptures have declared, that this faith gives
the professors of it a right to baptism, as in the case of the
eunuch, Acts viii.&nbsp; When he demanded why he might not be
baptized, Philip answered, that if he believed with all his
heart, he might.&nbsp; The eunuch thereupon confessing Christ,
was baptized.</p>
<p>Now, that baptism is essential to church-communion, I prove
from 1 Cor. xii., where we shall find the apostle labouring to
prevent an evil use that might be made of spiritual gifts, as
thereby to be puffed up, and to think that such as wanted them
were not of the body, or to be esteemed members: he thereupon
resolves, that whoever did confess Christ, and own him for his
head, did it by the Spirit, ver. 3, though they might not have
such a visible manifestation of it as others had, and therefore
they ought to be owned as members, as appears, ver. 23.&nbsp; And
not only because they have called him Lord by the Spirit, but
because they have, by the guidance and direction of the same
Spirit, been baptized, ver. 13, &ldquo;For by one Spirit we are
all baptized into one body,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; I need not go
about to confute that notion that some of late have had of this
text., viz., that the baptism here spoken of is the baptism of
the Spirit, because you have not owned and declared that notion
as your judgment, but on the contrary, all of you that I have
ever conversed with, have declared it to be understood of baptism
with water, by the direction of the Spirit: If so, then it
follows, that men and women are declared members of
Christ&rsquo;s body by baptism, and cannot be by scripture
reputed and esteemed so without it; which farther appears from
Rom. vi. 5, where men by baptism are said to be
&ldquo;planted&rdquo; into the likeness of his death and Col. ii.
12, we are said to be &ldquo;buried with him&rdquo; by
baptism.&nbsp; All which, together with the consent of all
Christians (some few in these later times excepted), do prove
that baptism is necessary to the initiating persons into the
Church of Christ.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; Holiness of life is essential to church-communion,
because it seems to be the reason why Christ founded a church in
the world, viz., that men might thereby be watched over, and kept
from falling; and that if any be overtaken with a fault, he that
is spiritual might restore him, that by this means men and women
might be preserved without blame to the coming of Christ; and the
grace of God teacheth us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
and to live soberly and uprightly in this present evil world;
Tit. ii. 11, 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;And let every one that nameth the
name of Christ, depart from iniquity;&rdquo; 2 Tim. ii. 19.&nbsp;
And James tells us (speaking of the Christian religion), that
&ldquo;pure religion, and undefiled before God, is this, To visit
the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
ourselves unspotted from the world;&rdquo; James i. 27.&nbsp;
From all which (together with many more texts that might be
produced) it appears, that an unholy and profane life is
inconsistent with Christian religion and society; and that
holiness is essential to salvation and church-communion.&nbsp; So
that these three things, faith, baptism, and a holy life, as I
said before, all churches must agree and unite in, as those
things which, when wanting, will destroy their being.&nbsp; And
let not any think, that when I say, believing the Son of God died
for the sins of men is essential to salvation and
church-communion, that I hereby would exclude all other articles
of the Christian creed as not necessary; as the belief of the
resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment, &amp;c., which,
for want of time, I omit to speak particularly to, and the
rather, because I understand this great article of believing the
Son of God died for the sins of men is comprehensive of all
others, and is that from whence all other articles may easily be
inferred.</p>
<p>And here I would not be mistaken, as though I held there was
nothing else for Christians to practise, when I say this is all
that is requisite to church-communion; for I very well know, that
Christ requires many other things of us, after we are members of
his body, which, if we knowingly or maliciously refuse, may be
the cause, not only of excommunication, but damnation.&nbsp; But
yet these are such things as relate to the well-being and not to
the being of churches; as laying on of hands in the primitive
times upon believers, by which they did receive the gifts of the
Spirit: This, I say, was for the increase and edifying of the
body, and not that thereby they might become of the body of
Christ, for that they were before.&nbsp; And do not think that I
believe laying on of hands was no apostolical institution,
because I say men are not thereby made members of Christ&rsquo;s
body, or because I say that it is not essential to
church-communion.&nbsp; Why should I be thought to be against a
fire in the chimney, because I say it must not be in the thatch
of the house?&nbsp; Consider, then, how pernicious a thing it is
to make every doctrine (though true) the bond of communion; this
is that which destroys unity, and by this rule all men must be
perfect before they can be in peace: for do we not see daily,
that as soon as men come to a clearer understanding of the mind
of God (to say the best of what they hold), that presently all
men are excommunicable, if not damnable, that do not agree with
them.&nbsp; Do not some believe and see that to be pride and
covetousness, which others do not, because (it may be) they have
more narrowly and diligently searched into their duty of these
things than others have?&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Must all men that
have not so large acquaintance of their duty herein be
excommunicated?&nbsp; Indeed it were to be wished that more
moderation in apparel and secular concernments were found among
churches: but God forbid, that if they should come short herein,
that we should say, as one lately said, that he could not
communicate with such a people, because they were proud and
superfluous in their apparel.</p>
<p>Let me appeal to such, and demand of them, if there was not a
time, since they believed and were baptized, wherein they did not
believe laying on of hands a duty? and did they not then believe,
and do they not still believe, they were members of the body of
Christ?&nbsp; And was not there a time when you did not so well
understand the nature and extent of pride and covetousness as now
you do?&nbsp; And did you not then believe, and do you not still
believe, that you were true members of Christ, though less
perfect?&nbsp; Why then should you not judge of those that differ
from you herein, as you judged of yourselves when you were as
they now are?&nbsp; How needful then is it for Christians to
distinguish (if ever they would be at peace and unity) between
those truths which are essential to church-communion, and those
that are not?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Unity and peace consists in all as with one shoulder
practising and putting in execution the things we do know; Phil.
iii. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nevertheless, whereto we have already
attained, let us walk by the same rule, and mind the same
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; How sad is it to see our zeal consume us and
our precious time in things doubtful and disputable, while we are
not concerned nor affected with the practice of those
indisputable things we all agree in!&nbsp; We all know charity to
be the great command, and yet how few agree to practise it?&nbsp;
We all know they that labour in the word and doctrine are worthy
of double honour; and that God hath ordained, that they which
preach the gospel should live of the gospel.&nbsp; These duties,
however others have cavilled at them, I know you agree in them,
and are persuaded of your duty therein: but where is your zeal to
practise?&nbsp; O how well would it be with churches, if they
were but half as zealous for the great, and plain, and
indisputable things, and the more chargeable and costly things of
religion, as they are for things doubtful or less necessary, or
for things that are no charge to them, and cost them nothing but
the breath of contention, though that may be too great a price
for the small things they purchase with it!</p>
<p>But further, Do we not all agree, that men that preach the
gospel should do it like workmen that need not be ashamed? and
yet how little is this considered by many preachers, who never
consider before they speak of what they say, or whereof they
affirm!&nbsp; How few give themselves to study that they may be
approved!&nbsp; How few meditate and give themselves to these
things, that their profiting may appear to all!</p>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s sake let us unite to practise those
things we know; and if we would have more talents, let us all
agree to improve those we have.</p>
<p>See the spirit that was among the primitive professors, that
knowing and believing how much it concerned them in the
propagating of Christianity, to shew forth love to one another
(that so all might know them to be Christ&rsquo;s disciples),
rather than there should be any complainings among them, they
sold all they had.&nbsp; O how zealous were these to practise,
and as with one shoulder to do that that was upon their hearts
for God!&nbsp; I might further add, how often have we agreed in
our judgment? and hath it not been upon our hearts, that this and
the other thing is good to be done, to enlighten the dark world,
and to repair the breaches of churches, and to raise up those
churches that now lie gasping, and among whom the soul of
religion is expiring?&nbsp; But what do we more than talk of
them?&nbsp; Do not most decline these things, when they either
call for their purses or their persons to help in this and such
like works as these?&nbsp; Let us then, in what we know, unite,
that we may put it in practice, remembering, that if we know
these things, we shall be happy if we do them.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; This unity and peace consists in our joining and
agreeing to pray for, and to press after, those truths we do not
know.&nbsp; The disciples in the primitive times were conscious
of their imperfections, and therefore they with one accord
continued in prayer and supplications.&nbsp; If we were more in
the sense of our ignorance and imperfections, we should carry it
better towards those that differ from us: then we should abound
more in the spirit of meekness and forbearance, that thereby we
might bring others (or be brought by others) to the knowledge of
the truth: this would make us go to God, and say with Elihu, Job
xxxiv. 32, &ldquo;That which we know not, teach thou
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brethren, did we but all agree that we were
erring in many things, we should soon agree to go to God, and
pray for more wisdom and revelation of his mind and will
concerning us.</p>
<p>But here is our misery, that we no sooner receive any thing
for truth, but we presently ascend the chair of infallibility
with it, as though in this we could not err: hence it is we are
impatient of contradiction, and become uncharitable to those that
are not of the same mind; but now a consciousness that we may
mistake, or that if my brother err in one thing, I may err in
another; this will unite us in affection, and engage us to press
after perfection, according to that of the apostle; Phil. iii.
13&ndash;15, &ldquo;Brethren, I count not myself to have
apprehended: But this one thing I do, forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; And if in any thing ye be
otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; O then that we could but unite and agree to go
to God for one another, in confidence that he will teach us; and
that if any one of us want wisdom (as who of us does not), we
might agree to ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth no man!&nbsp; Let us, like those people spoken of in
the 2d of Isaiah, say to one another, &ldquo;Come, let us go to
the Lord, for he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
his paths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; This unity and peace mainly consists in unity of love
and affection: this is the great and indispensable duty of all
Christians; by this they are declared Christ&rsquo;s disciples;
And hence it is that love is called &ldquo;the great
commandment,&rdquo; &ldquo;the old commandment,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the new commandment;&rdquo; that which was commanded in
the beginning, and will remain to the end, yea, and after the
end. 1 Cor. xiii. 8, &ldquo;Charity never faileth; but whether
there be tongues, they shall cease; or whether there be
knowledge, it shall vanish away.&rdquo;&nbsp; And ver. 13,
&ldquo;And now abideth faith, hope, charity; but the greatest of
these is charity.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Col. iii. 14, &ldquo;Above all
these things, put on charity, which is the bond of
perfectness;&rdquo; because charity is the end of the
commandment, 1 Tim. i. 5.&nbsp; Charity is therefore called
&ldquo;the royal law;&rdquo; as though it had a superintendency
over other laws, and doubtless is a law to which other laws must
give place, when they come in competition with it; &ldquo;above
all things, therefore, have fervent charity among yourselves; for
charity shall cover the multitude of sins;&rdquo; 1 Pet. iv.
8.&nbsp; Let us therefore live in unity and peace, and the God of
love and peace will be with us.</p>
<p>That you may so do, let me remind you (in the words of a
learned man), that the unity of the church is a unity of love and
affection, and not a bare uniformity of practice and opinion.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Having shewn you wherein this unity consists, I now
come to the third general thing propounded: and that is, to shew
you the fruits and benefits of unity and peace, together with the
mischiefs and inconveniences that attend those churches where
unity and peace are wanting.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Unity and peace is a duty well-pleasing to God, who
is styled the author of peace and not of confusion.&nbsp; In all
the churches God&rsquo;s Spirit rejoiceth in the unity of our
spirits; but on the other hand, where strife and divisions are,
there the Spirit of God is grieved.&nbsp; Hence it is that the
apostle no sooner calls upon the Ephesians not to grieve the
Spirit of God, but he presently subjoins us a remedy against that
evil, that they put away bitterness and evil-speaking, and be
kind one to another, and tender-hearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ&rsquo;s sake hath forgiven them; Eph. iv.
30, 32.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As unity and peace is pleasing to God, and rejoiceth
his Spirit, so it rejoiceth the hearts and spirits of God&rsquo;s
people.&nbsp; Unity and peace brings heaven down upon earth among
us: hence it is that the apostle tells us, Rom. iv. 17, that
&ldquo;the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Where unity and peace is, there is heaven upon earth; by this we
taste the first fruits of that blessed estate we shall one day
live in the fruition of; when we shall come &ldquo;to the general
assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in
heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just
men made perfect;&rdquo; Heb. xii. 23.</p>
<p>This outward peace of the church (as a learned man observes)
distils into peace of conscience, and turns writings and readings
of controversy into treatises of mortification and devotion.</p>
<p>And the Psalmist tells us, that it is not only good, but
pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity, Psalm
cxxxiii.&nbsp; But where unity and peace is wanting, there are
storms and troubles; &ldquo;where envy and strife is, there is
confusion and every evil work;&rdquo; James iii. 16.&nbsp; It is
the outward peace of the church that increaseth our inward joy;
and the peace of God&rsquo;s house gives us occasion to eat our
meat with gladness in our own houses, Acts ii. 46.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The unity and peace of the church makes communion of
saints desirable.&nbsp; What is it that embitters
church-communion, and makes it burdensome, but divisions?&nbsp;
Have you not heard many complain, that they are weary of
church-communion, because of church-contention? but now where
unity and peace is, there Christians long for communion.</p>
<p>David saith, that he was glad when they said unto him,
&ldquo;Let us go to the house of God;&rdquo; Psalm cxxii.
1.&nbsp; Why was this, but because (as the third verse tells us)
Jerusalem was a city compact together, where the tribes went up,
the tribes of the Lord, to give thanks to his name?&nbsp; And
David, speaking of the man that was once his friend, doth thereby
let us know the benefit of peace and unity; Psalm lv. 14.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;took sweet counsel together,
and walked to the house of God in company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where
unity is strongest, communion is sweetest and most
desirable.&nbsp; You see then that peace and union fills the
people of God with desires after communion: but, on the other
hand, hear how David complains, Psalm cxx., &ldquo;Wo is me, that
I sojourn in Mesech, and that I dwell in the tents of
Kedar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Psalmist here is thought to allude to a
sort of men that dwelt in the deserts of Arabia, that got their
livings by contention; and therefore he adds, ver. 6, that his
soul had long dwelt with them that hated peace.&nbsp; This was
that which made him long for the courts of God, and esteem one
day in his house better than a thousand.&nbsp; This made his soul
even faint for the house of God, because of the peace of it;
&ldquo;Blessed are they,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;that dwell in
thy house, they will be still praising thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is a certain note of concord, as appears, Acts ii., where we read
of primitive Christians, meeting with one accord, praising
God.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Where unity and peace is, there many mischiefs and
inconveniences are prevented, which attend those people where
peace and unity are wanting: and of those many that might be
mentioned, I shall briefly insist upon these nine.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Where unity and peace is wanting, there is much
precious time spent to no purpose.&nbsp; How many days are spent,
and how many fruitless journeys made to no profit, where the
people are not in peace? how often have many redeemed time (even
in seed-time and harvest) when they could scarce afford it, to go
to church, and, by reason of their divisions, come home worse
than they went, repenting they have spent so much precious time
to so little benefit?&nbsp; How sad is it to see men spend their
precious time, in which they should work out their salvation, in
labouring, as in the fire, to prove an uncertain and doubtful
proposition, and to trifle away their time, in which they should
make their calling and election sure, to make sure of an opinion,
which, when they have done all, they are not infallibly sure
whether it be true or no, because all things necessary to
salvation and church-communion are plainly laid down in
scripture, in which we may be infallibly sure of the truth of
them; but for other things that we have no plain texts for, but
the truth of them depends upon our interpretations, here we must
be cautioned, that we do not spend much time in imposing those
upon others, or venting those among others, unless we can assume
infallibility, otherwise we spend time upon uncertainty.&nbsp;
And whoever casts their eyes abroad, and do open their ears to
intelligence, shall both see, and to their sorrow hear, that many
churches spend most of their time in jangling and contending
about those things which are neither essential to salvation nor
church-communion; and that which is worse, about such doubtful
questions which they are never able to give an infallible
solution of.&nbsp; But now where unity and peace is, there our
time is spent in praising God; and in those great questions, What
we should do to be saved? and, How we may be more holy and more
humble towards God, and more charitable and more serviceable to
one another?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Where unity and peace is wanting, there is evil
surmising and evil speaking, to the damage and disgrace, if not
to the ruining, of one another; Gal. v. 14, 15.&nbsp; The whole
law is fulfilled in one word, &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.&nbsp; But if you bite and devour one
another, take heed you be not consumed one of
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner the bond of charity is broken,
which is as a wall about Christians, but soon they begin to make
havock and spoil of one another; then there is raising evil
reports, and taking up evil reports, against each other.&nbsp;
Hence it is that whispering and backbiting proceeds, and going
from house to house to blazon the faults and infirmities of
others: hence it is that we watch for the haltings of one
another, and do inwardly rejoice at the miscarriages of others,
saying in our hearts, &ldquo;ha! ha! so we would have it:&rdquo;
but now where unity and peace is, there is charity; and where
charity is, there we are willing to hide the faults, and cover
the nakedness, of our brethren.&nbsp; &ldquo;Charity thinketh no
evil;&rdquo; 1 Cor. xiii. 5; and therefore it cannot surmise,
neither will it speak evil.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Where unity and peace is wanting, there can be no
great matters enterprised&mdash;we cannot do much for God, nor
much for one another; when the devil would hinder the bringing to
pass of good in nations and churches, he divides their counsels
(and as one well observes), he divides their heads, that he may
divide their hands; when Jacob had prophesied of the cruelty of
Simon and Levi, who were brethren, he threatens them with the
consequent of it; Gen. xlix. 7, &ldquo;I will divide them in
Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The devil is not
to learn that maxim he hath taught the Machiavellians of the
world, <i>Divide et impera</i>; divide and rule.&nbsp; It is an
united force that is formidable.&nbsp; Hence the spouse in the
Canticles is said to be but one, and the only one of her mother;
Cant. vi. 9.&nbsp; Here upon it is said of her, ver. 10,
&ldquo;That she is terrible as an army with banners.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What can a divided army do, or a disordered army that have lost
their banners, or for fear or shame thrown them away?&nbsp; In
like manner, what can Christians do for Christ, and the enlarging
of his dominions in the world, in bringing men from darkness to
light, while themselves are divided and disordered?&nbsp; Peace
is to Christians as great rivers are to some cities, which
(besides other benefits and commodities) are natural
fortifications by reason whereof those places are made
impregnable; but when, by the subtilty of an adversary or the
folly of the citizens, these waters come to be divided into
little petty rivulets, how soon are they assailed and
taken?&nbsp; Thus it fares with churches, when once the devil or
their own folly divides them, they will be so far from resisting
of him, that they will be soon subjected by him.</p>
<p>Peace is to churches as walls to a city; nay, unity hath
defended cities that had no walls.&nbsp; It was once demanded of
Agesilaus, why Lacedemon had no walls; he answers (pointing back
to the city), That the concord of the citizens was the strength
of the city.&nbsp; In like manner, Christians are strong when
united; then they are more capable to resist temptation, and to
succour such as are tempted.&nbsp; When unity and peace is among
the churches, then are they like a walled town; and when peace is
the church&rsquo;s walls, salvation will be her bulwarks.</p>
<p>Plutarch tells us of one Silurus that had eighty sons, whom he
calls to him as he lay upon his death-bed, and gave them a sheaf
of arrows, thereby to signify, that if they lived in unity, they
might do much, but if they divided, they would come to
nothing.&nbsp; If Christians were all of one piece, if they were
all but one lump, or but one sheaf or bundle, how great are the
things they might do for Christ and his people in the world,
whereas otherwise they can do little but dishonour him, and
offend his!</p>
<p>It is reported of the leviathan, that his strength is in his
scales; Job xli. 15&ndash;17, &ldquo;His scales are his pride,
shut up together as with a close seal; one is so near to another,
that no air can come between them: they are joined together, they
stick together, they cannot be sundered.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the
church of God were united like the scales of the leviathan, it
would not be every brain-sick notion, nor angry speculation, that
would cause its separation.</p>
<p>Solomon saith, &ldquo;Two are better than one,&rdquo; because,
if one fall, the other may raise him; then surely twenty are
better than two, and an hundred are better than twenty, for the
same reason; because they are more capable to help one
another.&nbsp; If ever Christians would do any thing to raise up
the fallen tabernacles of Jacob, and to strengthen the weak, and
comfort the feeble, and to fetch back those that have gone
astray, it must be by unity.</p>
<p>We read of the men of Babel, Gen xi. 6, &ldquo;The Lord said,
Behold, the people are one, &amp;c., and now nothing will be
restrained from them that they have imagined to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We learn by reason, what great things may be done in worldly
achievements where unity is; and shall not reason (assisted with
the motives of religion) teach us, that unity among Christians
may enable them to enterprise greater things for Christ?&nbsp;
Would not this make Satan fall from heaven like lightning?&nbsp;
For as unity built literal Babel, it is unity that must pull down
mystical Babel.&nbsp; And, on the other hand, where divisions
are, there is confusion; by this means a Babel hath been built in
every age.&nbsp; It hath been observed by a learned man&mdash;and
I wish I could not say truly observed&mdash;that there is most of
Babel and confusion among those that cry out most against it.</p>
<p>Would we have a hand to destroy Babylon? let us have a heart
to unite one among another.</p>
<p>Our English histories tell us, that after Austin the monk had
been some time in England, he heard of some of the remains of the
British Christians, which he convened to a place which Cambden in
his Britannia calls &ldquo;Austin&rsquo;s Oak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
they met to consult about matters of religion; but such was their
division, by reason of Austin&rsquo;s imposing spirit, that our
stories tell us that synod was only famous for this, that they
only met and did nothing.&nbsp; This is the mischief of
divisions&mdash;they hinder the doing of much good; and if
Christians that are divided be ever famous for any thing, it will
be, that they have often met together, and talked of this and the
other thing, but they did nothing.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Where unity and peace is wanting, there the weak are
wounded, and the wicked are hardened.&nbsp; Unity may well be
compared to precious oil, Psalm cxxxiii. 2.&nbsp; It is the
nature of oil to heal that which is wounded, and to soften that
which is hard.&nbsp; Those men that have hardened themselves
against God, and his people, when they shall behold unity and
peace among them, will say, God is in them indeed: and on the
other hand, are they not ready to say, when they see you divided,
That the devil is in you that you cannot agree!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Divisions and want of peace keep those out of the
church that would come in; and cause many to go out that are
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The divisions of Christians (as a learned man observes)
are a scandal to the Jews, an opprobrium to the Gentiles, and an
inlet to atheism and infidelity:&rdquo; insomuch that our
controversies about religion (especially as they have been of
late managed) have made religion itself become a
controversy.&nbsp; O then, how good and pleasant a thing is it
for brethren to dwell together in unity!&nbsp; The peace and
unity that was among the primitive Christians drew others to
them.&nbsp; What hinders the conversion of the Jews, but the
divisions of Christians?&nbsp; Must I be a Christian? says the
Jew.&nbsp; What Christian must I be? what sect must I be
of?&nbsp; The Jews (as one observes), glossing upon that text in
Isa. xi. 6, where it is prophesied, That the lion and the lamb
shall lie down together, and that there shall be none left to
hurt nor destroy in all God&rsquo;s holy mountain: they
interpreting these sayings to signify the concord and peace that
shall be among the people that shall own the Messiah, do from
hence conclude, that the Messiah is not yet come, because of the
contentions and divisions that are among those that profess
him.&nbsp; And the apostle saith, 1 Cor. xiv. 23, that if an
unbeliever should see their disorders, he would say they were
mad; but where unity and peace is, there the churches are
multiplied.&nbsp; We read, Acts ix., that when the churches had
rest, they multiplied; and Acts ii. 46, 47, when the church was
serving God with one accord, &ldquo;the Lord added to them daily
such as should be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unity brings men into the church, and divisions keep
them out.&nbsp; It is reported of an Indian, passing by the house
of a Christian, and hearing them contending, being desired to
turn in, he refused, saying, &ldquo;Habamach dwells there,&rdquo;
meaning that the devil dwelt there: but where unity and peace is,
there God is; and he that dwells in love, dwells in God.&nbsp;
The apostle tells the Corinthians, that if they walked orderly,
even the unbelievers would hereby be enforced to come and
worship, and say, God was in them indeed.&nbsp; And we read,
Zech. viii. 23, of a time when ten men shall take hold of a Jew,
and say, &ldquo;We will go with you, for we have heard that God
is with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And hence it is that Christ prays, John xvii. 21, that his
disciples might be one, as the Father and he were one, that the
world might believe the Father sent him: as if he should say, you
may preach me as long as you will, and to little purpose, if you
are not at peace and unity among yourselves.&nbsp; Such was the
unity of Christians in former days, that the intelligent heathen
would say of them, that though they had many bodies, yet they had
but one soul.&nbsp; And we read the same of them, Acts iv. 32,
that &ldquo;the multitude of them that believed were of one heart
and one soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the learned Stillingfleet observes in his Irenicum:
&ldquo;The unity and peace that was then among Christians made
religion amiable in the judgment of impartial heathens:
Christians were then known by the benignity and sweetness of
their dispositions, by the candour and ingenuity of their
spirits, by their mutual love, forbearance, and condescension to
one another.&nbsp; But either this is not the practice of
Christianity (viz., a duty that Christians are now bound to
observe), or else it is not calculated for our meridian, where
the spirits of men are of too high an elevation for it; for if
pride and uncharitableness, if divisions and strifes, if wrath
and envy, if animosities and contentions, were but the marks of
true Christians, Diogenes need never light his lamp at noon to
find out such among us; but if a spirit of meekness, gentleness,
and condescension, if a stooping to the weaknesses and
infirmities of one another, if pursuit after peace, when it flies
from us, be the indispensable duties, and characteristical notes
of Christians, it may possibly prove a difficult inquest to find
out such among the crowds of those that shelter themselves under
that glorious name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the unity and peace of churches that brings others to
them, and makes Christianity amiable.&nbsp; What is prophesied of
the church of the Jews may in this case be applied to the Gentile
church, Isa. lxvi. 12, that when once God extends peace to her
like a river, the Gentiles shall come in like a flowing stream;
then (and not till then) the glory of the Lord shall arise upon
his churches, and his glory shall be seen among them; then shall
their hearts fear and be enlarged, because the abundance of the
nations shall be converted to them.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; As want of unity and peace keeps those out of the
church that would come in, so it hinders the growth of those that
are in.&nbsp; Jars and divisions, wranglings and prejudices, eat
out the growth, if not the life of religion.&nbsp; These are
those waters of Marah, that embitter our spirits, and quench the
Spirit of God.&nbsp; Unity and peace is said to be like the dew
of Hermon, and as a dew that descended upon Sion, where the Lord
commanded his blessing; Psalm cxxxiii. 3.</p>
<p>Divisions run religion into briars and thorns, contentions and
parties.&nbsp; Divisions are to churches like wars in countries:
where wars are, the ground lieth waste and untilled, none takes
care of it.&nbsp; It is love that edifieth, but division pulleth
down.&nbsp; Divisions are as the north-east wind to the fruits,
which causeth them to dwindle away to nothing; but when the
storms are over, every thing begins to grow.&nbsp; When men are
divided, they seldom speak the truth in love; and then no marvel
they grow not up to him in all things, who is the head.</p>
<p>It is a sad presage of an approaching famine (as one well
observes), not of bread nor water, but of hearing the word of
God, when the thin ears of corn devour the plump full ones; when
the lean kine devour the fat ones; when our controversies about
doubtful things, and things of less moment, eat up our zeal for
the more indisputable and practical things in religion which may
give us cause to fear, that this will be the character by which
our age will be known to posterity&mdash;that it was the age that
talked of religion most, and loved it least.</p>
<p>Look upon those churches where peace is, and there you shall
find prosperity.&nbsp; When the churches had rest, they were not
only multiplied, but, walking in the fear of the Lord and the
comforts of the Holy Ghost, they were edified; it is when the
whole body is knit together, as with joints and hands, that they
increase with the increase of God.</p>
<p>We are at a stand sometimes, why there is so little growth
among churches, why men have been so long in learning; and are
yet so far from attaining the knowledge of the truth; some have
given one reason, and some another; some say pride is the cause,
and others say covetousness is the cause.&nbsp; I wish I could
say these were no causes; but I observe, that when God entered
his controversy with his people of old, he mainly insisted upon
some one sin, as idolatry, and shedding innocent blood, &amp;c.,
as comprehensive of the rest; not but that they were guilty of
other sins, but those that were the most capital are particularly
insisted on: in like manner, whoever would but take a review of
churches that live in contentions and divisions, may easily find
that breach of unity and charity is their capital sin, and the
occasion of all other sins.&nbsp; No marvel then, that the
Scripture saith, the whole law is fulfilled in love: and if so,
then where love is wanting, it needs must follow the whole law is
broken.&nbsp; It is where love grows cold that sin abounds; and
therefore the want of unity and peace is the cause of that
leanness and barrenness that is among us; it is true in
spirituals as well as temporals, that peace brings plenty.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Where unity and peace is wanting, our prayers are
hindered; the promise is, that what we shall agree to ask shall
be given us of our heavenly Father: no marvel we pray and pray,
and yet are not answered; it is because we are not agreed what to
have.</p>
<p>It is reported that the people in Lacedemonia, coming to make
supplication to their idol god, some of them asked for rain, and
others of them asked for fair weather: the oracle returns them
this answer, That they should go first and agree among
themselves.&nbsp; Would a heathen god refuse to answer such
prayers in which the supplicants were not agreed, and shall we
think the true God will answer them?</p>
<p>We see then that divisions hinder our prayers, and lay a
prohibition on our sacrifice: &ldquo;If thou bring thy gift to
the altar,&rdquo; saith Christ, &ldquo;and there remember that
thy brother hath aught against thee, leave thy gift, and go, and
first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that want of unity and charity hinders even
our particular prayers and devotions.</p>
<p>This hindered the prayers and fastings of the people of old
from finding acceptance; Isa. lviii. 3.&nbsp; The people ask the
reason wherefore they fasted, and God did not see nor take notice
of them.&nbsp; He gives this reason, Because they fasted for
strife and debate, and hid their face from their own flesh.&nbsp;
Again, Isa. lix., the Lord saith, his hand was not shortened,
that he could not save; nor his ear heavy, that he could not
hear: but their sins had separated between their God and
them.&nbsp; And among those many sins they stood chargeable with,
this was none of the least, viz., that the way of peace they had
not known.&nbsp; You see where peace was wanting, prayers were
hindered, both under the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of the people, in the 65th of Isaiah, that said,
&ldquo;Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou,&rdquo; was a
smoke in the nostrils of the Lord.&nbsp; On the other hand, we
read how acceptable those prayers were that were made with one
accord, Acts iv. 24, compared with verse 31.&nbsp; They prayed
with one accord, and they were all of one heart, and of one soul:
And see the benefit of it, &ldquo;They were all filled with the
Holy Ghost, and spoke the word with all boldness;&rdquo; which
was the very thing they prayed for, as appears verse 29.&nbsp;
And the apostle exhorts the husband to dwell with his wife, that
their prayers might not be hindered; 1 Pet. iii. 7.&nbsp; We see
then want of unity and peace, either in families or churches, is
a hinderance of prayers.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; It is a dishonour and disparagement to Christ that
his family should be divided.&nbsp; When an army falls into
mutiny and division, it reflects disparagement on him that hath
the conduct of it.&nbsp; In like manner, the divisions of
families are a dishonour to the heads, and those that govern
them.&nbsp; And if so, then how greatly do we dishonour our Lord
and governor, who gave his body to be broken to keep his church
from breaking, who prayed for their peace and unity, and left
peace at his departing from them for a legacy, even a peace which
the world could not bestow upon them.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Where there is peace and unity, there is a sympathy
with each other; that which is the want of one will be the want
of all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is afflicted,&rdquo; saith the apostle,
&ldquo;and I burn not?&rdquo;&nbsp; We should then
&ldquo;remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and
them which suffer adversity, as being ourselves also of the
body;&rdquo; Heb. xiii. 3.&nbsp; But where the body is broken, or
men are not reckoned or esteemed of the body, no marvel we are so
little affected with such as are afflicted.&nbsp; Where divisions
are, that which is the joy of the one is the grief of another;
but where unity and peace and charity abound, there we shall find
Christians in mourning with them that mourn, and rejoicing with
them that rejoice; then they will not envy the prosperity of
others, nor secretly rejoice at the miseries or miscarriages of
any.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Last of all, I now come to give you twelve
directions and motives for the obtaining peace and unity.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If ever we would live in peace and unity, we must
pray for it.&nbsp; We are required to seek peace: of whom then
can we seek it with expectation to find it, but of him who is a
God of peace, and hath promised to bless his people with
peace?&nbsp; It is God that hath promised to give his people one
heart, and one way; yet for all these things he will be sought
unto: O then let us seek peace, and pray for peace, because God
shall prosper them that love it.</p>
<p>The peace of churches is that which the apostle prays for in
all his epistles; in which his desire is, that grace and peace
may be multiplied and increased among them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They that would endeavour the peace of the churches,
must be careful who they commit the care and oversight of the
churches to; as (1.)&mdash;Over and besides those qualifications
that should be in all Christians, they that rule the church of
God should be men of counsel and understanding.&nbsp; Where there
is an ignorant ministry, there is commonly an ignorant people,
according as it was of old&mdash;Like priest like people.</p>
<p>How sad is it to see the church of God committed to the care
of such that pretend to be teachers of others, that understand
not what they say, or whereof they affirm.&nbsp; No marvel the
peace of churches is broken, when their watchmen want skill to
preserve their unity, which of all other things is as the
church&rsquo;s walls; when they are divided, no wonder they
crumble to atoms, if there is no skilful physician to heal
them.&nbsp; It is sad when there is no balm in Gilead, and when
there is no physician there.&nbsp; Hence it is, that the wounds
of churches become incurable, like the wounds of God&rsquo;s
people of old, either not healed at all, or else slightly healed,
and to no purpose.&nbsp; May it not be said of many churches this
day, as God said of the church of Israel, That he sought for a
man among them that should stand in the gap, and make up the
breach; but he found none?</p>
<p>Remember what was said of old, Mal. ii. 7, The priest&rsquo;s
lips preserve knowledge: and the people should seek the law at
his mouth.&nbsp; But when this is wanting, the people will be
stumbling, and departing from God and one another; therefore God
complains, Hos. iv. 6, That his people were destroyed for want of
knowledge; that is, for want of knowing guides; for if the light
that is in them that teach be darkness, how great is that
darkness! and if the blind lead the blind, no marvel both fall
into the ditch.</p>
<p>How many are there that take upon them to teach others, that
had need be taught in the beginning of religion; that instead of
multiplying knowledge, multiply words without knowledge; and
instead of making known God&rsquo;s counsel, darken counsel by
words without knowledge?&nbsp; The apostle speaks of some that
did more than darken counsel; for they wrested the counsel of
God; 2 Pet. iii. 16.&nbsp; In Paul&rsquo;s epistles, saith he,
&ldquo;are some things hard to be understood, which they that are
unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other
scriptures, to their own destruction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some things in
the Scriptures are hard to be known, and they are made harder by
such unlearned teachers as utter their own notions by words
without knowledge.</p>
<p>None are more bold and adventurous to take upon them to
expound the dark mysteries and sayings of the prophets and
Revelations, and the 9th of the Romans, which I believe contains
some of those many things which, in Paul&rsquo;s epistles, Peter
saith, were &ldquo;hard to be understood;&rdquo; I say none are
more forward to dig in these mines than those that can hardly
give a sound reason for the first principles of religion; and
such as are ignorant of many more weighty things that are easily
to be seen in the face and superficies of the Scripture; nothing
will serve these but swimming in the deeps, when they have not
yet learned to wade through the shallows of the Scriptures: like
the Gnosticks of old, who thought they knew all things, though
they knew nothing as they ought to know.&nbsp; And as those
Gnosticks did of old, so do such teachers of late break the unity
and peace of churches.</p>
<p>How needful then is it, that if we desire the peace of
churches, that we choose out men of knowledge, who may be able to
keep them from being shattered and scattered with every wind of
doctrine: and who may be able to convince and stop the mouths of
gainsayers.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; You must not only choose men of counsel, but if you
would design the unity and peace of the churches, you must choose
men of courage to govern them; for as there must be wisdom to
hear with some, so there must be courage to correct others: as
some must be instructed meekly, so others must be rebuked
sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; there must be
wisdom to rebuke some within long-suffering, and there must be
courage to suppress and stop the mouths of others.&nbsp; The
apostle tells Titus of some whose mouths must be stopped, or else
they would subvert whole houses, Titus i. 11.&nbsp; Where this
courage hath been wanting, not only whole houses, but whole
churches have been subverted.&nbsp; And Paul tells the Galatians,
that when he saw some endeavour to bring the churches into
bondage, that he did not give place to them, no not for an hour,
&amp;c, Gal. ii. 5.&nbsp; If this course had been taken by the
rulers of churches, their peace had not been so often invaded by
unruly and vain talkers.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In choosing men to rule (if you would endeavour to
keep the unity of the Spirit, and the bond of peace thereby), be
careful you choose men of peaceable dispositions.&nbsp; That
which hath much annoyed the peace of churches hath been the
froward and perverse spirits of the rulers thereof.&nbsp; Solomon
therefore adviseth, That with a furious man we should not go,
lest we learn his ways, and get a snare to our souls, Prov. xxii.
24, 25, and with the froward we learn frowardness.&nbsp; How do
some men&rsquo;s words eat like a canker; who instead of lifting
up their voices like a trumpet to sound a parley for peace, have
rather sounded an alarm to war and contention.&nbsp; If ever we
would live in peace, let us reverence the feet of them that bring
the glad tidings of it.</p>
<p>O how have some men made it their business to preach
contentions, and upon their entertainment of every novel opinion
to preach separation!&nbsp; How hath God&rsquo;s word been
stretched and torn to furnish these men with arguments to tear
churches!&nbsp; Have not our ears heard those texts that say,
&ldquo;Come out from among them, and be separate,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
and &ldquo;Withdraw from every brother that walks
disorderly?&rdquo;&nbsp; I say, have we not heard these texts
that were written to prevent disorder brought to countenance the
greatest disorder that ever was in the church of God, even schism
and division? whereas one of these exhortations was written to
the church of Corinth to separate themselves from the
idol&rsquo;s temple, and the idol&rsquo;s table, in which many of
them lived in the participation of, notwithstanding their
profession of the true God; as appears, 2 Cor. vi. 1.6, 17,
compared with 1 Cor. viii. 7, and as 1 Cor. x. 14, 20, 22,
recites; and not for some few or more members, who shall make
themselves both judges and parties to make separation, when and
as often as they please, from the whole congregation and church
of God, where they stood related; for by the same rule, and upon
the same ground, may others start some new question among these
new separatists, and become their own judges of the
communicableness of them, and thereupon make another separation
from these, till at last two be not left to walk together.&nbsp;
And for that other text mentioned, 2 Thess. iii. 6, where Paul
exhorts the church of Thessalonica to withdraw themselves from
every brother that walks disorderly; I cannot but wonder that any
should bring this to justify their separation or withdrawal from
the communion of a true (though a disorderly) church.&nbsp;
For,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Consider, that this was not writ for a few members
to withdraw from the church, but for the church to withdraw from
disorderly members.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Consider, that if any offended members, upon
pretence of error, either in doctrine or practice, should by this
text become judges (as well as parties) of the grounds and
lawfulness of their separation; then it will follow, that half a
score notorious heretics, or scandalous livers (when they have
walked so as they forsee the church are ready to deal with them,
and withdraw from them), shall anticipate the church, and pretend
somewhat against them, of which themselves must be judges, and so
withdraw from the church, pretending either heresy or disorder;
and so condemn the church, to prevent the disgrace of being
condemned by the church.&nbsp; How needful then is it, that men
of peaceable dispositions, and not of froward and fractious and
dividing spirits, be chosen to rule the church of God, for fear
lest the whole church be leavened and soured by them!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As there must be care used in choosing men to rule
the church of God, so there must be a consideration had, that
there are many things darkly laid down in scripture; this will
temper our spirits, and make us live in peace and unity the more
firmly in things in which we agree; this will help us to bear one
another&rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ,
inasmuch as all things necessary to salvation and church
communion are plainly laid down in scripture.&nbsp; And where
things are more darkly laid down, we should consider that God
intended hereby to stir up our diligence, that thereby we might
increase our knowledge, and not our divisions, for it may be said
of all discoveries of truth we have made in the Scriptures, as it
is said of the globe of the earth, that though men have made
great searches, and thereupon great discoveries, yet there is
still a <i>terra incognita</i>, an unknown land; so there is in
the Scriptures: for after men have travelled over them, one age
after another, yet still there is, as it were, a <i>terra
incognita</i>, an unknown track to put us upon farther search and
inquiry, and to keep us from censuring and falling out with those
who have not yet made the same discoveries; that so we may say
with the Psalmist, when we reflect upon our short apprehensions
of the mind of God, that we have seen an end of all perfection,
but God&rsquo;s commands are exceeding broad; and as one
observes, speaking of the Scriptures, that there is a path in
them leading to the mind of God, which lieth a great distance
from the thoughts and apprehensions of men.&nbsp; And on the
other hand, in many other places, God sits, as it were, on the
superficies, and the face of the letter, where he that runs may
discern him speaking plainly, and no parable at all.&nbsp; How
should the consideration of this induce us to a peaceable
deportment towards those that differ!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; If we would endeavour peace and unity, we must
consider how God hath tempered the body, that so the comely parts
should not separate from the uncomely, as having no need of them;
1 Cor. xii. 23&ndash;25.&nbsp; There is in Christ&rsquo;s body
and house some members and vessels less honourable; 2 Tim. ii.
20.&nbsp; And therefore we should not, as some now-a-days do,
pour the more abundant disgrace, instead of putting the more
abundant honour upon them.&nbsp; Did we but consider this, we
should be covering the weakness, and hiding the miscarriages of
one another, because we are all members one of another, and the
most useless member in his place is useful.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; If we would live in peace, let us remember our
relations to God, as children to a father, and to each other as
brethren.&nbsp; Will not the thoughts that we have one Father,
quiet us; and the thoughts that we are brethren, unite us?&nbsp;
It was this that made Abraham propose terms of peace to Lot; Gen.
xiii, &ldquo;Let there be no strife,&rdquo; saith he,
&ldquo;between us, for we are brethren.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we read
of Moses, in Acts vii. 26, using this argument to reconcile those
that strove together, and to set them at one again:
&ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;you are brethren, why do you
wrong one another?&rdquo;&nbsp; A deep sense of this relation,
that we are brethren, would keep us from dividing.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; If we would preserve peace, let us mind the gifts and
graces and virtues that are in each other; let these be more in
our eye than their failings and imperfections.&nbsp; When the
apostle exhorted the Philippians to peace, as a means hereunto,
that so the peace of God might rule in their hearts, he tells
them, iv. 8, &ldquo;That if there were any virtue, or any praise,
they should think of these things.&rdquo;&nbsp; While we are
always talking and blazoning the faults of one another, and
spreading their infirmities, no marvel we are so little in peace
and charity; for as charity covereth a multitude of sins, so
malice covereth a multitude of virtues, and makes us deal by one
another, as the heathen persecutors dealt with Christians, viz.,
put them in bears&rsquo; skins, that they might the more readily
become a prey to those dogs that were designed to devour
them.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; If we would keep unity and peace, let us lay aside
provoking and dividing language, and forgive those that use
it.&nbsp; Remember that old saying, &ldquo;Evil words corrupt
good manners.&rdquo;&nbsp; When men think to carry all before
them, with speaking uncharitably and disgracefully of their
brethren or their opinions, may not such be answered as Job
answered his unfriendly visitants, Job vi. 25, &ldquo;How
forcible are right words; but what doth your arguing
reprove?&rdquo;&nbsp; How healing are words fitly spoken?&nbsp; A
word in season, how good is it?&nbsp; If we would seek peace, let
us clothe all our treaties for peace with acceptable words; and
where one word may better accommodate than another, let that be
used to express persons or things by; and let us not, as some do,
call the different practices of our brethren, will-worship, and
their different opinions, doctrines of devils, and the doctrine
of Balaam, who taught fornication, &amp;c., unless we can
plainly, and in expressness of terms, prove it so.&nbsp; Such
language as this hath strangely divided our spirits, and hardened
our hearts one towards another.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; If we would live in peace, let us make the best
constructions of one another&rsquo;s words and actions.&nbsp;
Charity judgeth the best, and it thinks no evil; if words and
actions may be construed to a good sense, let us never put a bad
construction upon them.&nbsp; How much hath the peace of
Christians been broken by an uncharitable interpretation of words
and actions?&nbsp; As some lay to the charge of others that which
they never said, so, by straining men&rsquo;s words, others lay
to their charge that they never thought.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Be willing to hear, and learn, and obey those that
God by his providence hath set over you; this is a great means to
preserve the unity and peace of churches: but when men (yea, and
sometimes women) shall usurp authority, and think themselves
wiser than their teachers, no wonder if these people run into
contentions and parties, when any shall say they are not free to
hear those whom the church thinks fit to speak to them.&nbsp;
This is the first step to schism, and is usually attended, if not
timely prevented, with a sinful separation.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; If you would keep the unity of the spirit in the
bond of peace, be mindful, that the God whom you serve is a God
of peace, and your Saviour is a Prince of peace, and that
&ldquo;his ways are ways of pleasantness, and all his paths are
peace;&rdquo; and that Christ was sent into the world &ldquo;to
give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of
death, and to guide our feet in the way of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Consider the oneness of spirit that is among the
enemies of religion; though they differ about other things, yet
to persecute religion, and extirpate religion out of the earth,
here they will agree; the devils in the air, and the devils in
the earth, all the devils in hell, and in the world, make one at
this turn.&nbsp; Shall the devil&rsquo;s kingdom be united; and
shall Christ&rsquo;s be divided?&nbsp; Shall the devils make one
shoulder to drive on the design of damning men, and shall not
Christians unite to carry on the great design of saving of
them?&nbsp; Shall the papists agree and unite to carry on their
interest, notwithstanding the multitudes of orders, degrees, and
differences, that are among them; and shall not those that call
themselves reformed churches, unite to carry on the common
interest of Christ in the world, notwithstanding some petty and
disputable differences that are among them?&nbsp; Quarrels about
religion (as one observes) were sins not named among the
Gentiles.&nbsp; What a shame is it then for Christians to abound
in them, especially considering the nature of the Christian
religion, and what large provisions the Author of it hath made,
to keep the profession&rsquo;s of it in peace! insomuch (as one
well observes), it is next to a miracle that ever any (especially
the professors of it) should fall out about it.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Consider and remember, that the Judge stands at the
door.&nbsp; Let this moderate your spirits, that the Lord is at
hand.&nbsp; What a sad account will they have to make when he
comes, that shall be found to smite their fellow-servants, and to
make the way to his kingdom more narrow than ever he made
it!&nbsp; Let me close all in the words of that great apostle, 2
Cor. xiii. 11, &ldquo;Finally, brethren, farewell.&nbsp; Be
perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and
the God of love and peace shall be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Postscript.&mdash;Reader, I thought good to advertise thee,
that I have delivered this to thy hand in the same order and
method in which it was preached, and almost in the same words,
without any diminishings or considerable enlargings, unless it be
in the thirteen last particulars; upon some of which I have made
some enlargements, which I could not then do for want of time;
but the substance of every one of them was then laid down in the
same particular order as here thou hast them.&nbsp; And now I
have done, I make no other account (to use the words of a
moderate man upon the like occasion) but it will fall out with
me, as doth commonly with him that parts a fray, both parties may
perhaps drive at me for wishing them no worse than peace.&nbsp;
My ambition of the public tranquillity of the church of God, I
hope, will carry me through these hazards; let both beat me, so
their quarrels may cease, I shall rejoice in those blows and
scars I shall take for the church&rsquo;s safety.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
